title: "When accessibility stops at captions"

When I browse streaming apps on my TV, I often struggle to read what’s on screen.

<!-- more -->

In some cases, the main browse experience relies almost entirely on movie poster images. If the title isn’t readable in the artwork, I’m left guessing. On other platforms, titles and descriptions _are_ present — but the text is so small that it’s difficult to read from across the room.

This is especially noticeable because many of these same apps allow extensive customization of closed captions.

## What’s happening

Most major streaming platforms support:

- Adjustable caption size
- Font and background controls
- High-contrast caption options

At the same time:

- Browse screens often use fixed, small text
- Titles may be hidden entirely in favor of imagery
- Metadata is hard to read at typical TV viewing distances

The accessibility support exists — it just stops at playback.

## Why this matters

If a user needs larger captions, they likely need larger navigation text too.

Treating captions as a special-case accessibility feature assumes that visual needs begin and end with dialogue. In reality, readability affects discovery, decision-making, and overall comfort long before a video starts playing.

This disproportionately impacts:

- Users with low or aging vision
- Anyone sitting farther from the screen
- Users relying on quick scanning rather than imagery

## The UX gap

The system already acknowledges that users have different visual needs — but it doesn’t carry that understanding throughout the experience.

Accessibility preferences are applied locally instead of globally.

## A practical improvement

Small, system-level changes could make browsing far more usable:

- A global text size preference (Small / Default / Large / Extra large)
- Optional always-visible titles under posters
- Better alignment with OS-level accessibility settings

None of this requires abandoning visual design — just giving users control over readability.

## Takeaway

Accessibility works best when it’s treated as a principle, not a feature.

When platforms recognize user needs in one part of the experience but ignore them elsewhere, the result is a fragmented and frustrating system — even when the right tools already exist.
