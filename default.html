                <p>Echo is quite an experienced traveller as well.  We left home on a 9 week, 15,000 mile trip with me when he was just 16 months old.  This is not the type of trip that would work for everyone, but we both returned unscathed from our adventure... on even more deeply bonded to one another.  Echo explored many sites around the country and won hearts everywhere he went. </p>

                    <li>One of his favorite destinations was White Sands National Monument in New Mexico where he got to play and dig in the sand.</li>
                    <li>He explored miles of carriage roads at Acadia National Park in Maine too.</li>
                    <li>He greatly enjoyed Yellowstone National Park where he really, really wanted to get out of the car and "play chase" with the buffalo.</li>
                    <li>His least favorite part of the trip might have been when he had to get onto a 20 foot boat so I could take pictures of a lighthouse in North Carolina.  As a typical basenji, he is not a fan of the water. </li>
