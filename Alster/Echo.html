                <p>I adopted my first basenji, Echo, in June 2011. I had read a lot about the breed online and had heard all the "horror stories" about living with such mischievious little dogs. It didn't scare me away though. I think it actually made them more interesting to me.</p>

                <p>So... I contacted a couple of local breeders and scheduled a visit with Katie Campbell of <a href="http://tajibasenjis.com" target="external">Taji Basenjis</a>. After meeting her pack and talking with her (and hearing her basenji stories), I was pretty sure this was the breed for me (they sounded a bit like me!).  It just so happened that she had an available puppy that day as well.  He was a 5+ month old tricolored boy named "Moose".  When I took him home a week later, we called him "MoosEcho" since I had decided to name him Echo.</p>

                <p>Echo is a sweet boy and is very easy to live with.  He's very social and wants to meet everyone... adults, children, and dogs alike.</p>

                <p>Echo was never a show dog, but he's had great successes on the field. Echo is a fantastic lure courser.  He's been a consistent runner for over 2 years (and A LOT) of trials.  He's proven himself running against the best dogs in the country and in trials in locations all over the country.</p>

                <h2>Travelogue</h2>
                <p>Echo is quite an experienced traveller as well.  We left home on a 9 week, 15,000 mile trip when he was just 16 months old.  This is not the type of trip that would work for everyone, but we both returned unscathed from our adventure... and even more deeply bonded to one another.  Echo explored many sites around the country and won hearts everywhere he went. </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>One of his favorite destinations was White Sands National Monument in New Mexico where he got to play and dig in the sand.</li>
                    <li>He explored miles of carriage roads at Acadia National Park in Maine too.</li>
                    <li>He greatly enjoyed Yellowstone National Park where he really, really wanted to get out of the car and "play chase" with the buffalo.</li>
                    <li>His least favorite part of the trip might have been when he had to get onto a 20 foot boat so I could take pictures of a lighthouse in North Carolina.  As a typical basenji, he is not a fan of the water. </li>
                </ul> 
                <p>I'll write much more about our trip soon.</p>
