# Sight. Scent. Hounds.

The Basenji is an ancient breed originating from Central Africa, known for their unique yodel-like sound instead of a traditional bark—often called a “baroo.”

Basenjis are part of the Hound group. Unlike most hounds, which are classified as either sighthounds or scenthounds, Basenjis are both. They hunt using their eyes, nose, and ears, making them versatile hunters of small game.

These intelligent, independent (often mischievous) hounds are known for their athletic build, curled tail, and wrinkled forehead. Basenjis excel in a wide variety of dog sports.
