## About me

I’m a software developer and dedicated basenji fancier living in the Pacific Northwest. When I’m not coding or working with my dogs, you’ll usually find me outdoors—often with a specific destination in mind.

## What I’m about

- [My why](my-why) — my personal philosophy and what drives me
- [Alster Basenjis](alster-basenjis) — my life with basenjis, including breeding, showing, and extensive community involvement

## Hobbies and interests

### Basenjis and dog sports

I’ve been deeply involved in the basenji community for over a decade, serving on boards, judging lure coursing trials, and competing with my dogs in conformation, lure coursing, rally, nose work, and more. See my [Alster Basenjis](alster-basenjis) page for details.

### Geodetic benchmark hunting

Another of my hobbies is seeking out USGS and other geodetic survey markers (benchmarks). These physical markers were placed by surveyors to establish precise geographic positions, and many date back decades—or even a century. I enjoy finding them in overlooked places, blending outdoor exploration with history and geography.

It’s also a connection to my dad, who worked for the Geological Survey of Alabama when I was born and first introduced me to benchmarks.

### UX and front-end development
